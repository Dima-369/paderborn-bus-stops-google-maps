# Displays all bus stops in Padernborn on Google Maps with markers

You have to refresh the site for the times to update.

On loading the website, it also queries the times from all bus stops which takes quite some time.

## Notes

* The `bus_stops.json` were scraped beforehand, a very long time ago, but I lost the script and don't quite remember where from
  * The latitude and longitude are not perfectly accurate
